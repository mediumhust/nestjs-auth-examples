# Nest JS Auth Examples

A number of examples of NestJS authentication. I will add to this over time.

# Installation

From each example directory, run NPM install:

```
npm i
```

And start the NestJS application:

```
npm start
```

Each of the examples can be accessed by `http://localhost:3000` from your HTTP client.

# Examples

Here's the examples in this repo:

## Basic Auth

A bery basic example of a Basic Auth implementation in a NestJS REST API.
